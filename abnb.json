				"description": "An object resembling a common rubber duck that is wearing a cylinder. The hat appears to be stuck, and attempts to pull it off have triggered anomalous behaviour in the object. The anomalous behaviour of the object is manifested in the form of an auditory illusion experienced by all people in a certain range that are considered to be 'participating in the conversation' by the abnormality. The people under the effect of the illusion can hear a male voice, described by employee [REDACTED] as 'vaguely teenage' and 'awkward'. The voice has a noticeable accent, and it insists that it is not a native english speaker. The abnormality is not in any way harmful, even struggling to carry out verbal abuse under the pretence of 'not wanting to make other people's day worse than it has to be'. Therefore, it can be concluded that despite possessing some anomalous capabilities, it is harmless and is otherwise an ordinary rubber duck."
