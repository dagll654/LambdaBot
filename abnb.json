				"description": "O-04-13 is an object resembling a common rubber duck that is wearing a cylinder. The hat appears to be stuck, and attempts to pull it off have triggered anomalous behaviour in O-04-13. The anomalous behaviour of O-04-13 is manifested in the form of an auditory illusion experienced by all people in a certain range that are considered to be 'participating in the conversation' by the abnormality. The people under the effect of the illusion can hear a male voice, described by employee [REDACTED] as 'vaguely teenage' and 'awkward'. The voice has a noticeable accent, and it insists that english isn't its native language. The abnormality is not in any way harmful, even struggling to carry out verbal abuse under the pretence of 'not wanting to make other people's day worse than it has to be'. Therefore, it can be concluded that despite possessing some anomalous capabilities, it is harmless and is otherwise an ordinary rubber duck.",

				"description": "O-01-06 appears to be a tall, dark creature in a black suit with a white bowtie. The abnormality does not show any interest in communication, but has shown the ability to talk, if one manages to reach a certain level of closeness with it. The abnormality sometimes refers to itself as a musician, and another anomalous property of O-01-06 is its ability to find a normal-sized piano within 10 meters of its location at the time when it shows an interest in playing it. The mechanism of the piano's arrival is unknown, since the employees that work on it when the abnormality exhibits anomalous behaviour have reported that 'the piano was always in the containment chamber', and all recordings from any security cameras that could shed some light on the piano's arrival mechanism appear to be corrupted. Surprisingly, O-01-06 is not actually able to produce any music, but it sometimes makes attempts at doing so. The 'music' that it plays can be heard quietly by every creature on Earth. The performance causes a small amount of white damage to all people in the facility. The only known way to avoid the effects of the performance is the abnormality's EGO Gift. Upon further testing it has been found that only people within the radius of approximately 200 meters from the abnormality are able to retain the memory of the performance, while everyone outside of that radius immediately forgets about the event after it is over. The abnormality itself has never shown any signs of aggression, but its performances, albeit rare, can cause disastrous consequences.",
